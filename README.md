# Fragments of Self

![](docs/screenshot.jpg)

This is a procedural artwork released at Revision 2024, placing 3rd in the 4KB Executable Graphics competition.

This source code release is for archival reasons - as such, aside from removal of compiled and intermediate binaries, this is an unedited snapshot of the source from when the released artwork was built.

Two versions have been archived â€” a [preliminary version](https://github.com/lunasorcery/yx-fragments-of-self/tree/f8ca1e7354bf9e691ccc0dce86690d0480d11f23) uploaded to partymeister a few hours ahead of the deadline, and a [second version](https://github.com/lunasorcery/yx-fragments-of-self/tree/15c903c9ef1799d4cfb2801244808fd4c6f5467f) featuring some further tweaks, mostly around the ribbon bookmark. The second version was shown and released at the party.

As with all [Blossom](https://github.com/lunasorcery/Blossom) works, this uses [Shader_Minifier](https://github.com/laurentlb/Shader_Minifier) for shader minification and [Crinkler](https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler) for executable compression. Binaries are included in the archive as the exact versions that were used for the release.
